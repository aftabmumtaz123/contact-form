## Responsive Contact Form with Tailwind CSS (aftabmumtaz123)

This is a basic contact form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Tailwind CSS for styling. It features a responsive layout, animations, and dynamic copyright information.

**Features:**

- **Contact Form:** Users can submit their name, email, and message through the form.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Leverages Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive layout.
- **Animations:** Includes subtle animations for a visually appealing experience.
- **Dynamic Copyright:** Displays a copyright message with the current year using JavaScript.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML: Defines the structure of the page.
- CSS: Styles the form and layout (Tailwind CSS is used for most styling).
- JavaScript: Adds dynamic behavior (e.g., copyright update).

**How it Works:**

1. The HTML code structures the page layout, including the form elements.
2. Tailwind CSS styles the elements (background, colors, spacing, etc.).
3. Custom CSS adds footer styling and positions it at the bottom of the page.
4. JavaScript retrieves the current date and dynamically updates the copyright text in the footer.

**Customization:**

- Modify the form fields and placeholder text to suit your needs.
- Change the Tailwind CSS classes to customize the appearance further.
- Add additional CSS animations for more interactivity.
- Connect the form to a backend script to process submissions (not included in this example).

**Deployment:**

- This code can be hosted on static web hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

**License:**

(Consider adding a license to your project, such as MIT or Apache. This helps clarify how others can use and distribute your code.)

I hope this enhanced README file provides clear information about your contact form and its functionalities!
